# WordPress Plugin Template
Over the past couple of years I've expiremented with multiple PHP frameworks and MVC based applications, such as WordPress, Slim, Laravel and Symfony. This is my attempt to cherry pick my favourite features of developing for those applications into a template for a WordPress plugin.

## Features
- Annotation based hooks (actions and filters)
- PHP Code Sniffer (WPCS and Neutron Style)
- PHPStan (Static code testing)
