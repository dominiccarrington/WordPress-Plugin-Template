# WordPress Plugin Template

Over the past couple of years I've expiremented with multiple PHP frameworks and MVC based applications, such as WordPress, Slim, Laravel and Symfony. This is my attempt to cherry pick my favourite features of developing for those applications into a template for a WordPress plugin.

## Features
- Annotation based hooks (actions and filters)
- WPCS and Neutron Style Checking
- Static testing
- Unit testing

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Static tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
composer test:static
```

### Coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
composer test:style
```
